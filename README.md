# 🤖Basic spam bot detection algorithm
An algorithm that identifies spam bots with 40 %* accuracy. 

This code was written for fun to experiment with PRAW. 
>*⚠️
>
> 678 different Reddit accounts (bots accounts and non-bots accounts) were used for testing. At most 100 submissions (posts+comments) were analysed for each account. The algorithm assumed that the list of bots contains spam bots only so the presence of non-spam bots significantly reduced its accuracy.
# 🚀Setup #

1. All the code required is in `main.py`.

1. Fill the required details for the Reddit instance.

1. Call function `BotScore` as shown below :

```python
print(BotScore('Most-Boring-Bot', k)) 
# k : number of posts to be analysed. 0 < k < 1000
```
Output :
```
115.44958793954774
True
```
The first number is indicates the likelihood of being a spam bot. (the higher the number the more likely)

The function returns True if the user `u/Most-Boring-Bot` is a spam bot.

Algorithm works best when the user has more than 20 posts/comments and when k > 30 

`data.txt` contains a list of Reddit usernames of bots and real people which have been used for testing.

# 🔮Future work #
### Sample data improvements ###
- [ ] Remove accounts with less than 100 comments and 100 posts 
- [ ] Remove non-spam bots from list of bots. 
### Heuristics improvements ###
- [ ] Check for URL shorteners and whether comments link to the same sites 
- [ ] Check if same links appear in several comments
- [ ] Use better statistical methods to find threshold human/bot
- [ ] Improve algorithm for checking similarity between posts/comments (check word frequency, grammatical mistakes, ...)
